# CTTC Project

In this Github folder, I'm gathering all the code I've used in the work I've been doing so far. The list of notebooks are the following:
- `Dataset_construction.ipynb`: notebook used to create the datasets used for training and for testing respectively.
- `CPUs.ipynb`: notebook used to time the different lazy strategies as well as the exhaustive search strategy.
