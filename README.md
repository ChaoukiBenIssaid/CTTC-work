# CTTC Project

In this Github folder, I'm gathering all the code I've used in the work I've been doing so far. The list of notebooks are the following:
- `Dataset_construction.ipynb`: notebook used to create the datasets used for training and for testing respectively.
- `data.csv` and `test_data.csv` are two csv files containing the training and test sets respectively with the names of the channel matrice **H** and power matrice **P** and the "true" label obtained from the exhaustive search strategy.
- `CPUs.ipynb`: notebook used to time the different lazy strategies as well as the exhaustive search strategy.
